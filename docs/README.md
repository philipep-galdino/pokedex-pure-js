A Pokedex built purely with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

This whole app is based on the lecturing video from Roger Melo's playlist on [Getting Fluent with Pure Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uptu3NrBFBM&list=PLpSJMw6H4PFMOJHMULTxKNOEw7g1cBuyP&index=6) (it's in portuguese-brazilian)

# About the application

This Pokedex requests the [Pokéapi](pokeapi.co), an API with all infos about all the 150 Pokemons in the series with pure Javascript and sets up a functioning handler for all informations requested to the API.

My intuition with this application was to learn more ways to handle web apps problems with pure Javascript in a way I can get to know better about how frameworks built with this language could work. 

I also put in some effort on the documentation of the code, with better commentings than in my projects before and a real nice brief about my project.

### What did I learn with this project?

In this project I implemented what I've learned in Roger Melo's video mostly, and applied a lot of knowledge that I've carried away from other lectures. These are:

- the functioning of a Promise from scratch
- what it is and how does a Closure idea work
- best practices and refactoring for better code reading


You can also check out the [TODO list](https://github.com/philipep-galdino/pokedex-pure-js/blob/master/docs/TODO.md)!

These are ideas I have to put in the project, after following the whole original idea from the video, and trying to put in practice what I learned with new implementations.

# Project Setup

Firstly, I obviously didn't use any server or anything alike for this application, so these steps are simple to see it in production/use for development:

Simply clone the project and open it in VSCode, once you're in, right click in the index.html file and select 'Open with Liver Server' (You can also just use ALT + L ALT + O). PS: You need the Live Server Extension for VSCode.

```
git clone https://github.com/philipep-galdino/pokedex-pure-js
```
